# Simon-Game (DESKTOP ONLY)
Hi there everyone and future me reading this! In this project I will present a game that I've recreated with the main focus on learning about to use jQuery.
Thanks to jQuery I've been able to write shorter, sweeter and often more comprehensible code.

## Preview:

As this is a frontend project, it is hosted on GitHub: https://ninjin96.github.io/Simon-Game/.

Alternatively, you can download the code and open the HTML file.

## What does it do?
This project is actually a recreation of the game Simon. In this game you are supposed to keep up with a certain sequence of colors and everytime you remember it correctly another color will be added to the sequence.

Try it out for yourself and check out of far you can come!

Thanks again for checking out my project and take care!

## Extra Information
This project is obviously not perfect. Maybe some things could have been made better like the interface. But the main idea of this project was to learn and play a bit with jQuery.
